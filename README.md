# Work in Progress
    I have struggled for two days straight with this project. After getting nowhere,
    I decided it would be best to scrap my assignment full of errors with no fix in sight and start over.
    I am nowhere near complete with this but my eyes are crossing and I'll only do more harm than good if I continue
    to stay up to work on this assignment. I will continue to work on it for education sake and hope that I can get some
    partial credit when I can complete a full assignment.
